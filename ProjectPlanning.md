Some steps to help with project planning:
1. Brainstorm ideas
2. Decide on an attainable early end goal (keep it small)
3. Determine the appropriate tech stack (what tech to use)
4. Design database schema early (if you need one)
5. Identify 3rd party tools that would speed up the process (extra stuff to use)
6. Set a schedule (trello)
